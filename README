ndo does things N times. 

SYNOPSIS

  mc = Ndo::MultiCommand.new('uname -n', %w(hostA hostB hostC))
  results = mc.run
  
  results['hostA'] # => 'hostA'
  results.each do |result|
    result # => "hostA", "hostB", "hostC"
  end
  
ON THE COMMAND LINE

1) Create a host set

A host set is a file in below ~/.ndo that contains a list of host names,
separated by newlines. Easily generated. 

2) Run a command on a host set

  $ ndo my_host_set ls

As you can see, it appears that time synch works on these machines. 

STATUS

This is a very early version; It could handle errors better. That said, ndo is
a very useful tool that can replace vlad or capistrano for easy things.
